# LocationLocationLocation

## Synopsis

Some Javascript and a calling HTML document which implement the [Google Maps
Javascript API](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html "Google Maps
Javascript API") to manipulate a map and retrieve the geographical coordinates
of a marker on the map.

Useful for quickly finding geographical coordinates from an address or location
string via Google's own geocoding mechanism.  Or just for understanding how the
Google Maps API works.

Hope it helps!
